## GLAMM - Genome linked (aka Google-like) Application for Metabolic Maps.

Taking this over was my first task as a member of the Arkin lab at LBNL. It was an ongoing project that made a pretty, interactive map of metabolism that could have data painted on it.

I eventually added visualizing flux data (results of flux balance analysis) to go along with fitness and other expression data. I also tinkered with dynamically adding random extra reactions, though that didn't end so well.

My additional work was included on a latter-day RegPrecise publication.
