## Turn on your Heart Light.

I gave my girlfriend (now wife, so I did something right) a box with a heart in it.

Made the heart out of resin, and I embedded a couple blinky LEDs in it.

I programmed a microcontroller to blink those LEDs to behave like a heartbeat. In particular, I scraped a year's worth of data off the Fitbit I used to wear, and built a model equation of what my heart rate looked like over the course of a day.

Equal parts power-nerd and artist, I'd like to think.
