## "How can I hold your hand?"

The first project I made for my wife.

We started our relationship living about 3000 miles apart. She wanted to hold my hand. I took that literally and made a silicone cast of my own hand and squashed some hardware in there. That hardware would talk to an opposite hand somewhere across the internet (at my house). As she squeezed hers, mine would light up, and as I squeezed (squoze?) mine, her's would light up.

Creepy, nerdy, and fun. That's how I roll.
